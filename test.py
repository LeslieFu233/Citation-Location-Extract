str1 = 'Lake Tana basin is undergoing rapid transformation due to increase in population and subsequent needs for agricultural and settlement lands as well as urbanization in recent times The Lake Tana watershed is a sensitive ecosystem due to conversion of arable land to farmland Previous studies focused on assessing climate change signal, hydrology, LULC change and the expansion of invasive species (e.g., water hyacinth) However, the impact of LULC change on the climate of the watershed has been overlooked In this study, firstly the spatio-temporal change of major LULC types namely grassland, cropland, water bodies, evergreen-leaf/mixed forest, Savana, built-up, wetland and baren land over Lake Tana watershed from 2001 to 2020 has been assessed.Secondly, the spatio-temporal pattern of LST and its relationship with LULC change and NDVI are analyzed.Finally, OMR is used as an independent tool to confirm the observed change in LST arising from LULC change as captured from associations between LST and LULC change.The conversion of water bodies and baren land to wetland (Tables Recent studies have indicated the presence of broad water hyacinth expansion in Lake Tana and over its shorelines in their recent study The conversion of grass land to savanna and forest land (Tables The seasonal climatology of LST (Fig. The lowest LST during JJA and SON is likely due to reduced insolation arising from higher cloud coverage during these seasons than during DJF and MAM In addition, LST is modulated by high seasonal vegetation The cooling trend over southern tip of the Lake Tana basin during DJF arises from the increase in savanna and forest between 2009 and 2020 (see also Fig. Surface temperature depends on local activities and type of LULC     In this study, we find that the changes from baren land to wetland, from grass land to savanna, from forest and baren land to wetland lead to cooling (Fig. Our findings are consistent with past studies (e.g., over India, Mexico) that have shown LST values are high wherever there is less vegetation cover Overall, our findings on impact of LULC change on LST suggest that the alteration of more vegetative area into less vegetative area results in warming consistent with past studies (e.g., For instance, alternation (Table The response to the net vegetation increase is notable from downward increase in rate of LST change over Savanna and baren land.The baren land was converted to wetland and water bodies which have higher heat capacity resulting in a decrease in LST.The impact of vegetation cover can also be inferred from the relationship between NDVI and LST (Fig. Generally, the LST and NDVI has inverse relationship but this relationship is slightly weakened during summer rainy months during intense solar insolation.This shows the radiative flux exchange between atmosphere, biosphere and land surface is strong and weakly depends on surface roughness due to vegetation cover during summer months This agrees with results of previous study on the relation between LST and NDVI in Northern America The high value of NDVI during and post rainy season can be associated with extension of vegetation growth well into autumn (October to November) Therefore, during spring season, the strength of the LST-NDVI correlation is mainly due to the high amount of chlorophyll and moisture content in green vegetation Similar results were found by Our observations are consistent with findings of In general, the low LST anomalies (Fig. This relationship is in accordance with the understanding that evapotranspiration from vegetation cools the surface However, the contrasting LST responses in 2005 and 2015 to LULC conversion need further discussion.In 2015 the vegetation cover over southern and eastern tips of Lake Tana basin has been converted to Savanna and forest from grassland.Grassland has strong LST modulation compared to Savanna and forest as it strongly controls radiative flux between land surface and the atmosphere leading to the two distinct LST responses The preceding discussions based on the relationships between LULC and LST, and NDVI and LST clearly demonstrate the impact of land use changes on surface temperature.OMR method is used to strengthen the conclusions derived from the above analysis.It is used to disentangle temperature change induced by LULC change
